# HW02-A

**This is a submission of Homework for Week 2 Part A.**

This repository contains a p5.js sketch that generates a centered grid pattern of colored squares on the canvas. 

Canvas Setup: The canvas is initialized to the full browser window size, and the background is set to a soft beige color (rgb(236, 209, 161)).

Grid Layout: A 4x4 grid of squares is drawn, with each square being 50x50 pixels and a 10-pixel padding between them. The grid is centered on the canvas using calculated startX and startY positions.

Color Scheme: Different shades of blue, brown, and teal are used for the squares, with colors assigned row by row to create a repeating, balanced pattern.
